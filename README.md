# LoRa-Tx-PCB

## Assignment
One circuit is given (PNG form), which is supposed to be used as a sensor node. It contains LoRa module, XIAO Esp32 s3 module, DHT11 (temperature & humidity), LDR (Light dependant resistor) and few other basic components. This circuit is used to send Temperature, Humidity and Light intensity values wirelesly over LoRa to Lora Receiver.

### Task
All necessary components are mentioned in the circuit, your task is to create the same circuit in your favourite PCB designing software (KiCAD, Eagle Easyeda etc) and then create a final PCB out of it. Please note that there are some requirements are given you need to follow those as well.

1. PCB dimentions - 30x55 mm (rectangle)
2. Spacing between ESP32 headers on the PCB should be 15.24 mm
3. Routing and component placement should be optimized and efficient.
